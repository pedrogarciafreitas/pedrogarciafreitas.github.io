I received Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Informatics from the Computer Science department 
of the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB), Brazil. I also received a B.Sc. in 
Computational Physics from UnB. During my Ph.D., I spent one year between 2014
and 2015 as a visiting researcher at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft),
Netherlands. I had worked as software developer in different projects at 
LabRedes, UnB. I had also worked as data science research assistant at the
Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA). I served as information systems
technician at the Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LCC) in UnB, where I
had been developing systems for automation and management of clusters, networks
and computer resources used in the LCC. Currently, I am working as researcher
at Samsung Research in Brazil (SRBR). My professional and research interests
are in the area of computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
